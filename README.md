# Poincare-sums-for-AdS3-gravity-and-RCFT-partition-functions

This repository contains python scripts for computing Poincaré sums for AdS3 gravity and RCFT partition functions using [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org).

The code was used for computing Poincaré sums appearing in the work [arXiv:2102.03136](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03136)
